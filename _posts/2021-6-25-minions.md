Hey! Minions have stolen my flag, encoded it few times in one cipher, and then hidden it somewhere there: https://mega.nz/file/1UBViYgD#kjKISs9pUB4E-1d79166FeX3TiY5VQcHJ_GrcMbaLhg Can you help me? TIP: Decode the flag until you got a sentence.

File: [THE_FILE](https://github.com/Yorzaren/ctf/raw/master/CTFlearn/problem-files/Hey_You.png "Download file")

Solution: 

`exiftool Hey_You.png`

Theres a warning `Warning: [minor] Trailer data after PNG IEND chunk`

`binwalk Hey_You.png`

Theres files `binwalk Hey_You.png -Me`

`cd _Hey_You.png.extracted/`

Theres a rar file. `unrar x D3EDB.rar`

```

Get the file 

binwalk and extract the files

Check the new image

`strings YouWon\(Almost\).jpg  | grep {`

Looks like a possible flag. Also dont forget (TIP: Decode the flag until you got a sentence.)

Looks like base64
