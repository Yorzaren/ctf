Problem: PROBLEM_TEXT

File: [THE_FILE](https://github.com/Yorzaren/ctf/raw/master/picoCTF-2021/problem-files/python-wrangling.flag.txt.en "Download file")
File: [THE_FILE](https://github.com/Yorzaren/ctf/raw/master/picoCTF-2021/problem-files/python-wrangling-pw.txt "Download file")
File: [THE_FILE](https://github.com/Yorzaren/ctf/raw/master/picoCTF-2021/problem-files/python-wrangling-script.py "Download file")

Solution: 

Run the python code by using ```python ende.py``` (which I renamed in this repo to python-wrangling-script.py) The program uses -d and then a file argument. 

```
python ende.py -d flag.txt.en
```
