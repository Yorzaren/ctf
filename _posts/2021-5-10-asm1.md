Solution: 

```
asm1:
	<+0>:	push   ebp; ebp = 0x610
	<+1>:	mov    ebp,esp; ebp=esp=0x610
	<+3>:	cmp    DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8],0x3b9; 0x610 with 0x3b9 = 0x610 (1552) with 0x3b9 (953)
	<+10>:	jg     0x50f <asm1+34>; jp if the previous is greater it is so move to line 34
	<+12>:	cmp    DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8],0x1
	<+16>:	jne    0x507 <asm1+26>
	<+18>:	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]
	<+21>:	add    eax,0x11
	<+24>:	jmp    0x526 <asm1+57>
	<+26>:	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]
	<+29>:	sub    eax,0x11
	<+32>:	jmp    0x526 <asm1+57>
	<+34>:	cmp    DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8],0x477; 0x610 with 0x477.
	<+41>:	jne    0x520 <asm1+51>; 0x610 != 0x477 is true so jump to 51
	<+43>:	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]
	<+46>:	sub    eax,0x11
	<+49>:	jmp    0x526 <asm1+57>
	<+51>:	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]; eax = 0x610
	<+54>:	add    eax,0x11; eax = 0x610+0x11 = 1552+17 = 1569 or 0x621
	<+57>:	pop    ebp; Jump here
	<+58>:	ret    
```

```asm1(0x610)```

When the function is called it pushes ```0x610``` to ```ebp```. 

Line 2: copy ebp to esp. So ebp=esp.

Line 3: Compare ebp with 0x3b9. So 0x610 with 0x3b9. 0x610 is larger.

Line 4: jump if prev is greater. It is jump line 34.

Line 34: Compare 0x610 with 0x477.

Line 41: 0x610 != 0x477 is true so jump to 51. 

Line 51: eax = 0x610

Line 54: eax = 0x610+0x11 = 1552+17 = 1569 or 0x621

Line 57: Pop 0x621

Line 58: Return 0x621

Flag: ```picoCTF{0x621}```
