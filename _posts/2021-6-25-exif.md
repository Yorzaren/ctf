If only the password were in the image?

https://mega.nz/#!SDpF0aYC!fkkhBJuBBtBKGsLTDiF2NuLihP2WRd97Iynd3PhWqRw You could really ‘own’ it with exif.

File: [THE_FILE](https://github.com/Yorzaren/ctf/raw/master/CTFlearn/problem-files/exif.jpg "Download file")

Solution: 

run `exiftool [filename]`

And the hint is the look at the owner.

```
Owner Name                      : flag{3l1t3_3x1f_4uth0r1ty_dud3br0}
```

Flag: `flag{3l1t3_3x1f_4uth0r1ty_dud3br0}`
