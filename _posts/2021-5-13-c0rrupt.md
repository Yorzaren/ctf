Problem: We found this file. Recover the flag. You can also find the file in /problems/c0rrupt_0_1fcad1344c25a122a00721e4af86de13.

File: [THE_FILE](https://github.com/Yorzaren/ctf/raw/master/picoCTF-2019/problem-files/c0rrupt "Download file")

Solution: Opening the file in a text editor you see ...

Remember that the starting header for a png is ```89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A```

This file has: ```89 65 4E 34 0D 0A B0 AA``` so lets correct that.

File is still broken when you try it.

Note: ```43 22 44 52``` (C"DR) is should be ```49 48 44 52```. (IHDR)

```AB 44 45 54``` should be ```49 44 41 54``` to fix the IDAT.
