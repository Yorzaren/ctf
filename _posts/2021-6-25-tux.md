The flag is hidden inside the Penguin! Solve this challenge before solving my 100 point Scope challenge which uses similar techniques as this one.

```

Convert from base64: `Password: Linux12345`

`binwalk Tux.jpg -e --dd=".*"`

For some reason it freezes but just control z out of it and then run ls.

cd into the new folder. Theres a zip file. 

`unzip 1570.zip`

It will ask for the password, enter it.

Open the text file. `cat flag`
