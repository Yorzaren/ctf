Problem: Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/28717/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:28717

Solution: Go to the website and  view the code source. Check out the html, the css, and the js.

```	<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->```

```/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */```

```/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?2717d7be} */```

Flag: ```picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?2717d7be}```
