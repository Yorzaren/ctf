Problem: Using netcat (nc) will be a necessity throughout your adventure. Can you connect to ```2018shell.picoctf.com``` at port ```49387``` to get the flag?

Solution: Use linux or the [https://2018game.picoctf.com/shell](https://2018game.picoctf.com/shell) and use the following command.

```
nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 49387
```

This prints the flag to the console.
