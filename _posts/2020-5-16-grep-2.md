Problem: This one is a little bit harder. Can you find the flag in /problems/grep-2_3_826f886f547acb8a9c3fccb030e8168d/files on the shell server? Remember, grep is your friend.

Solution: 

Using your login go to [https://2018game.picoctf.com/shell](https://2018game.picoctf.com/shell)

change directories into the problem: ```cd /problems/grep-2_3_826f886f547acb8a9c3fccb030e8168d/files```

By using ```ls``` you can see that there's a crap ton of directories. 

```files0  files1  files2  files3  files4  files5  files6  files7  files8  files9```

To look at each file, you would take forever. 

Use ```cat``` and the ```*/*``` to read out all the files and then pipe ```|``` and grep ```grep pico```.

Code:
```cat */* | grep pico```

Flag: ```picoCTF{grep_r_and_you_will_find_556620f7}```
