Problem: I made a website so now you can log on to! I don't seem to have the admin password. See if you can't get to the flag. [http://2018shell.picoctf.com:5477](http://2018shell.picoctf.com:5477) (link)

Solution: You can enter anything as the username and password, but it won't let you see the flag.
