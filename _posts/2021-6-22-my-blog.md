Hi, I'm Noxtal! I have hidden a flag somewhere in my [Cyberworld](https://noxtal.com/) (AKA blog)... you may find a good application for your memory. ;)

Note: This is my real website (thus no deadly bug to exploit here). You might want to read some of my content (writeups, tutorials, and cheatsheets). I would be glad to receive any kind of feedback.

[Click here](https://noxtal.com/) to access it, have fun checking my blog out! Cheers!

Hint: replace the flag{} part with CTFlearn{}.

Solution: 

Open the web tools on the page and find in flag in the local storage. `flag{n7f_l0c4l_570r463_15n7_53cur3_570r463}`

Flag: `CTFlearn{n7f_l0c4l_570r463_15n7_53cur3_570r463}`
