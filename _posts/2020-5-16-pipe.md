Problem: During your adventure, you will likely encounter a situation where you need to process data that you receive over the network rather than through a file. Can you find a way to save the output from this program and search for the flag? Connect with ```2018shell.picoctf.com 2015```.

Solution:

Using nc connect to the server. 

```nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 2015```

What we get is never ending text and not the flag so using the pipe command we can search for the flag.

Using the pipe ( ```|``` ) command, we can chain the commands of using ```nc``` to connect to the server and ```grep``` to find the string, we can get the flag.

```nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 2015 | grep pico```

Flag: ```picoCTF{almost_like_mario_8861411c}```
