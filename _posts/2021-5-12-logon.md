Problem: The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as logon and find what they've been looking at? https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/47307/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:47307

Solution: Similar to a problem from a [previous year of the same name](https://yorzaren.github.io/ctf/picoctf-2018/logon/). There's a flag ```admin``` set to False.
