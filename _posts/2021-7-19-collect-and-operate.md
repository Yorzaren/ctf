Ans: `Disable or Remove Feature or Program`

###Collect and Operate: Anomaly 50 (20pts)
Your IR team has just received a Cyber bulletin from your SOC & ISAC partners regarding threats posed by unmanned aircraft systems or drones. Confirm where the report speaks to how commercial UAS variations communicate with both ground stations and operators. Examine the description of the feeds used and what this allows a malicious actor to perform.

Should data be extracted by a malicious actor, which MITRE ATT&CK technique speaks to exfiltration of data over a radio frequency (RF) channel (or Wi-Fi) where the traffic is not routed through the same enterprise network?

Received word that some of our employee’s email addresses were included in a recent email dump. I’ve attached the sqlite database that has been making the rounds. When you get a chance, can you determine the unique amount of our employee’s emails are included in this dump? Once we have that number, we can determine next steps. 

Thanks
