Here is a file with another file hidden inside it. Can you extract it? https://mega.nz/#!qbpUTYiK!-deNdQJxsQS8bTSMxeUOtpEclCI-zpK7tbJiKV0tXYY

File: [THE_FILE](https://github.com/Yorzaren/ctf/raw/master/CTFlearn/problem-files/PurpleThing.jpeg "Download file")

Solution: 

Use binwalk on the file.

Note: if you try to use `binwalk -Me` you will not extract all the files.

`binwalk PurpleThing.jpeg -e --dd=".*"`

Will extract all the files and you will get the flag in the file `25795`
