Problem: Can you find the flag in this file without actually running it? You can also find the file in /problems/strings_2_b7404a3aee308619cb2ba79677989960 on the shell server.

File: [THE_FILE](https://github.com/Yorzaren/ctf/raw/master/picoCTF-2018/problem-files/strings "Download file")

Solution: To read the file you run the ```strings``` command. HOWEVER, the file is huge and you don't want to read the entire thing so use the pipe command and grep the flag out.

```strings strings | grep pico```

Flag: ```picoCTF{sTrIngS_sAVeS_Time_3f712a28}```
