Problem: Can you find the flag in file? This would be really obnoxious to look through by hand, see if you can find a faster way. You can also find the file in /problems/grep-1_4_0431431e36a950543a85426d0299343e on the shell server.

File: [THE_FILE](https://github.com/Yorzaren/ctf/raw/master/picoCTF-2018/problem-files/grep-1 "Download file")

Solution: In linux run ```cat file | grep pico```. The ```cat``` command reads out the file to the console and the ```|``` pipe command is chains the next command. ```grep``` searches for the string.

Flag: ```picoCTF{grep_and_you_will_find_d66382d8}```
