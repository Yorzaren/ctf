Problem: The one time pad can be cryptographically secure, but not when you know the key. Can you solve this? We've given you the encrypted flag, key, and a table to help UFJKXQZQUNB with the key of SOLVECRYPTO. Can you use this table to solve it?.

Solution: Its a Vigen√®re cipher. ```UFJKXQZQUNB``` becomes ```CRYPTOISFUN``` after using the given key.

Flag: ```picoCTF{CRYPTOISFUN}```
