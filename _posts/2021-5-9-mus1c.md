Problem: I wrote you a song. Put it in the picoCTF{} flag format

File: [THE_FILE](https://github.com/Yorzaren/ctf/raw/master/picoCTF-2019/problem-files/mus1c.txt "Download file")

Solution: The hint says: Do you think you can master rockstar?   So rockstar is a language. (https://codewithrockstar.com/) Theres an online try section where we can run the code. 

Putting the code into the section and nothing into the input. Give the following output ```114 114 114 111 99 107 110 114 110 48 49 49 51 114``` Which you convert from decimal to text and get ```rrrocknrn0113r```

Flag: ```picoCTF{rrrocknrn0113r}```
