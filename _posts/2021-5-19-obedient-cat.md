Problem: This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear"). Download flag.

File: [THE_FILE](https://github.com/Yorzaren/ctf/raw/master/picoCTF-2021/problem-files/obedient-cat "Download file")

Solution: You can either open the file and read the text or do it how they intended you to which is the open it using the terminal and the cat command.

```wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/704f877da185904ec3992e7255a15c6c/flag``` Will copy the flag file over and then you can ```cat flag```.
