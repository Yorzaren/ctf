Problem: Looks like someone started making a website but never got around to making a login, but I heard there was a flag if you were the admin. [http://2018shell.picoctf.com:52920](http://2018shell.picoctf.com:52920) (link)

Solution: On the site the login functions don't work. Hitting the flag button doesn't work as we need admin access. To fix this let's add a cookie named ```admin``` and set it to ```True```.
